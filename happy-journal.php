          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>This project is a reflection for year 2020. This is a tragic year for a lot of us. I still remember vividly when I heard the shocking news of Kobe Bryant passing in early 2020 and then the global pandemic occurs that forces us to stay at home. We are so used to socialize with one another, but now we have to practice social distancing. I want to bring some positivity to our lives, even though we're facing many hardships right now.</p>

          <h3>Concept</h3>
          <p>The concept of this project is about finding positivity in our lives and promote the app "The Happy Journal." The target audience are people who are suffering from mental health issues such as depression and anxiety because of the unhappy events that occurred in 2020.</p>
          <p>The project aims to tell the audience that even though we had faced so many difficulties and hardships, there are still things and people around us to appreciate and grateful for. Life is hard, but the little things happened to us help us become stronger and recharge our mind. The problem we are having right now is that the world is full of negativity and depressed thoughts, and by remembering the happy moments in our lives, it reduces the negative thinking in our minds</p>

          <p>2020 is definitely not a good year. We’ve lost valuable people in the world, been stuck at home because of the pandemic, lost homes because of the wildfire, and misinformation has separated us further and further… All of this is making us judge ourselves with negative thoughts and lose motivation to move on.
